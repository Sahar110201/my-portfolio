    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <div class="about-container">
    <p>My name is Sahar Adeeb, and I have a strong background in both business and technology. I earned a degree in Digital Enterprise Management from the University of Toronto, where I learned how technology shapes today’s businesses. This experience sparked my interest in the technical side of digital solutions, especially programming, which led me to study Computer Programming at Humber College. I am now building my skills in different programming languages and tools. I enjoy learning how software works, from basic logic and problem-solving to building full websites and apps. I have hands-on experience with HTML, CSS, and WordPress, which enables me to create websites that look good and are easy to use. I also have Microsoft Azure certifications, which taught me the basics of cloud computing and how to put software online.</p>
    <p>I am especially interested in both front-end and back-end development, and I want to improve my skills in programming languages such as JavaScript, Python, and Java, as well as in tools like React, Node.js, and Git. My goal is to become a skilled programmer who can help build useful and creative apps.</p>
    <p>I am looking to start my career at a company that values creativity, teamwork, and high-quality work, especially one that builds software and solves real problems with code. I do well in places where people keep learning, growing, and working together. Besides programming, I am very curious about technology. I often check out new technologies, tools, and devices, keep up with IT trends, and always look for ways to improve my technical and problem-solving skills. This passion drives me to try new things and tackle challenges in creative ways.</P>
    <p>If you are seeking an enthusiastic, adaptable, and motivated individual with a genuine passion for programming, I welcome the opportunity to connect and discuss how I can contribute meaningfully to your organisation.</P>
