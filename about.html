    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello! I'm Sahar Adeeb, a dedicated and curious individual with a strong foundation in both business and technology. I hold an undergraduate degree in Digital Enterprise Management from the University of Toronto, where I developed a solid understanding of how technology drives modern businesses and digital transformation. My academic journey sparked a deep interest in the technical side of digital solutions, especially programming which led me to pursue further education in Computer Programming at Humber College. Currently, I am sharpening my skills in various programming languages and development tools. I am passionate about learning how software is built from the ground up — from logic and algorithms to full-fledged web and application development. My journey so far has involved hands-on experience with HTML, CSS, and WordPress, which helped me create responsive, user-friendly websites. I also hold Microsoft Azure certifications, which have introduced me to cloud computing and deployment practices that are crucial in today’s tech landscape.</p>

<P>I am particularly interested in front-end and back-end development, and I am eager to expand my knowledge in languages such as JavaScript, Python, and Java, along with frameworks and tools like React, Node.js, and Git. My goal is to become a well-rounded programmer who can contribute to building impactful and innovative applications.</P>

<p>I am actively looking to start my professional journey in a company that values creativity, collaboration, and technical excellence — especially one that focuses on building software applications and solving real-world problems through code. I thrive in environments where I can continuously learn, grow, and challenge myself alongside like-minded professionals. Beyond coding, I have a natural curiosity for all things tech. I enjoy exploring new technologies, tools, and gadgets, staying up to date with IT trends, and constantly seeking ways to improve my technical and problem-solving skills. This passion keeps me motivated to push boundaries and think creatively in everything I do.</p>

<p>If you're looking for someone who is enthusiastic, adaptable, and genuinely excited about the world of programming, I'd love to connect and explore opportunities where I can make a meaningful impact.</p>
